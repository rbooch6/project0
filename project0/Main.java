 * I wasn't able to implement everything that I had hoped, so there is a lot of tester methods and variables inside to show generally what the end product would be.
 * There still might be some uncaught exceptions, however I believe most inputs are dealt with (even if too much so, like not being able to enter a decimal value when asked for a number because the '.' is not a number
